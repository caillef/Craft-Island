    Steampunk Car Set notes:

    1. All cars except car #4 are designed with driver's unarmed_sit_chair_upright position in mind.
    Car #4 calls for unarmed_sit_car_low.
    When you get on to customizing the vehicles, you may have to make necessary adjustments.

    2. Car #5 is a demi-tank, so its rear wheels are in fact tank treads. That is why both rear wheel
    fields of the template are left empty, treads being controlled by the Tank Tread smart object
    inside.
